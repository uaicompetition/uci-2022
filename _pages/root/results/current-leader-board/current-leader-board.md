The results below are organized as follows:
- each table displays the cumulative results for the given task under different time limits
- table values are average normalized scores across all evaluated problems as outlined in [Evaluation Criteria](https://uaicompetition.github.io/uci-2022/results/evaluation-criteria/)
- clicking on a solver name links to the results of the solver on the individual problem instances
